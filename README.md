## Description
This project was created for boot camp students, allowing them to guage their progress compared to their peers. A quiz was created to test users on Javascript fundamentals. 

When a person takes this quiz, they will quided through a series of multiple choice questions that correlate to a timer. If the user answers incorrectly, a 10 second deduction will be made to the remaining time. When the user cycles through all of the questions, they will be able to enter their initials and save their score to a high scores board.


## Usage

When a user first accesses the page, they will notice a title and short description of the quiz with a start button. In the upper left hand corner, the user can view the high scores by clicking the text. Clicking the text will lead the user to the stored high scores. If the user wants to begin the quiz, they click the button 'start quiz'. Event listeners have been added to the correlating buttons to enable the user to move through the questions. When user moves cursor over buttons, button is highlighted. 

After clicking start quiz, the timer in the upper right corner will start and user will be given first question with 4 possible multiple choice answers. If the user clicks the correct answer, they will see 'right' appear under the questions. Should they select the wrong answer, 'wrong' will appear under questions and 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. Once all questins are answered, user is then redirected to page where they can submit their initials to be logged with their score. The scores are recorded and put into a high score list. 

****link is not fully functional, will not record scores properly.
